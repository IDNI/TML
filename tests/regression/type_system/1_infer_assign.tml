# Transitive closure (TC)
#
# TC of a directed graph is simply another
# directed graph representing paths
# in the original graph.
#
# This is a classical example of recursion.
#
# Let's have a directed graph represented by
# following 'e' relation:

predtype e( int:4 ?a,  int:4 ?b).
#predtype tc ( int:4 ?a, int:4 ?b).

e(1 2).
e(2 2).
e(3 4).
e(4 5).
e(5 1).
e(7 9).

tc(?x ?y) :- e(?x ?y).
tc(?x ?y) :- e(?x ?z),tc(?z ?y).
kz(?a ?b) :- tc(?a ?b), ?a=?b.
