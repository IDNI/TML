# Transitive closure (TC)
#
# TC of a directed graph is simply another
# directed graph representing paths
# in the original graph.
#
# This is a classical example of recursion.
#
# Let's have a directed graph represented by
# following 'e' relation:

predtype e( int:8?a,  int:8 ?b).
predtype tc ( int:8 ?a, int:8 ?b).

e(17 2).
e(27 2).
e(37 33).
e(43 3).
e(55 1).
e(7 9).

tc(?x ?y) :- e(?x ?y).
tc(?x ?y) :- e(?x ?z),tc(?z ?y).
