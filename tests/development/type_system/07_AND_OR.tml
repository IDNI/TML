# When you need multiple conditions in a body
# separate them by a comma. You can read comma
# as 'and':

boy(?x) :- child(?x), male(?x).
# ?x is a boy if ?x is both child and male.

# head, you can have multiple rules with the
# same head:

# ?x is a human if ?x is child or adult.

adult(Amy).
child(John).
child(Jack).
