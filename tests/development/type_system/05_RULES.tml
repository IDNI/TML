# Rules allow creation/inferring of new facts.
# Every rule has a head and a body separated by
# ':-' symbol. Head is on the left side and body
# is on the right side.
# Rules are also called Horn Clauses.
# They work the way that head is true if body is
# true.
# You can imagine rules like facts (in head)
# with conditions (in body).

# TML takes all the known facts and tries to
# match them into bodies of all the known rules.
# When a fact matches a body of a rule it infers
# new fact from the head of the rule.



rain.                   # rain.
wet :- rain.            # wet if rain.
freezing :- bellowZero. # freezing if bellow 0.

# Here TML infers it's wet because it knows it
# rains.
# See there is 'rain' and 'wet' in the output.
# There is no 'freezing' because there is no
# 'bellowZero'.

p(1 2).           # 1-2 exists.
p(1 4).           # 1-4 exists.
p(3 1) :- p(1 3). # 3-1 exists if 1-3 exists.
p(2 1) :- p(1 2). # 2-1 exists if 1-2 exists.
