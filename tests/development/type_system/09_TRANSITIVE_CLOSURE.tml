# Transitive closure (TC)
#
# TC of a directed graph is simply another
# directed graph representing paths
# in the original graph.
#
# This is a classical example of recursion.
#
# Let's have a directed graph represented by
# following 'e' relation:

e(1 2).
e(2 3).
e(3 4).
e(4 5).
e(5 1).
e(8 9).

tc(?x ?y) :- e(?x ?y).
# Edge from ?x to ?y is a path from ?x to ?y.

tc(?x ?y) :- tc(?x ?z), e(?z ?y).
# If there is a path from ?x to ?z and there
# is an edge from ?z to ?y there is path from
# ?x to ?y

# TML infers all the possible paths in the
# 'e' graph into 'tc' graph.
