# Recursion is used to traverse through
# all the entities in a relation.
# It's a logic programs' alternative to loops.

# We can have a relation of parents.
parent(Fred Sue).
parent(Jack Fred).
parent(Amy Fred).
parent(Grace Amy).
parent(Tom Amy).

# Let's say we want to know all the ancestor
# relations of all the known entities.

# We need to create 2 rules so TML knows,
# what ancestor means. Ancestor is a parent
# or a parent of an ancestor.

# 'parent of a child is an ancestor of the
# child':
ancestor(?anc ?child) :-
    parent(?anc ?child).

# 'parent of a child, who is an ancestor of
# its descendant, is an ancestor of the
# descendant':
ancestor(?anc ?desc) :-
    parent(?anc ?child), ancestor(?child ?desc).

# Notice how ancestor relation is used in both
# head and body. This is causing the recursion.
